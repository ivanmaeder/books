# Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike

By Phil Knight (2016)

> I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And purposeful. And creative. And important. Above all… different.

> My psyche was in true harmony when I had a mix of alone time and team time.

> Each of us found pleasure, whenever possible, in focusing on one small task. One task, we often said, clears the mind.

> And yet we were always laughing. Sometimes, after a really cathartic guffaw, I’d look around the table and feel overcome by emotion. Camaraderie, loyalty, gratitude. Even love. Surely love.

> When you hired an accountant, you knew he or she could count. When you hired a lawyer, you knew he or she could talk. When you hired a marketing expert, or product developer, what did you know? Nothing.
