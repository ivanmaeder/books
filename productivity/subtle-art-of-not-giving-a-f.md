# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

By Mark Manson (2016)

## My Notes

> The vast majority of life is unextraordinary, indeed quite average.

You wouldn't think that by watching TV, etc—none of that is ordinary because it wouldn't be very interesting.

> Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you're exceptional at one thing, chances are you're average or below average at most other things.

Accept that you are not a unique and beautiful snowflake: it's fine for life to suck.

> Forms of blame and denial give us a quick high.

Choose the pain, not the goal—think systems, growth mindset.

> I was in love with the result—the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I was playing—but I wasn't in love with the process.

Separate emotions (e.g., being rejected) from the reality of the world (you're the same decaying organic matter as everything else).

> You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids.
