# The Little Book of Confidence

By Susan Jeffers (1999)

## My Notes

> Remember, feeling uncomfortable can be a good signâ€”it means that you're moving forwards and exploring unfamiliar territory, and in return you'll be more open to new people, places, experiences and adventures in your life.

> Think about the problem in the bigger story of your life. Will it still matter in a week, a month, or a year from now?

> Everybody starts from different points in life, which makes comparison pointless: what matters is that you are making progress on a path you have chosen for yourself.

> Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
