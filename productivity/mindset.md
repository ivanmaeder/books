# Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

By Carol Dweck (2006)

> Praising children's intelligence harms their motivation and it harms their performance.

> If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning.

## My Notes

### Fixed Mindset

- It's about proving you're smart, talented, attractive…
- You care about validating these qualities
- You fail when you lose, get fired, get rejected. It means you're not smart, talented, attractive…
- "Every comment, every look… registered on my intelligence scorecard, my attractiveness
scorecard, my likability scorecard…"
- You want to succeed without effort
- Instead of learning from errors, you seek to repair self-esteem
- You tell yourself stories of what you might have done; you try to protect your ego by not doing the challenging things
- You see other people as judging you
- You think that some people are superior and others inferior
- Groupthink
- Shy fixed-mindset people worry about being judged, embarrassed; they're anxious, blush, and avoid eye contact. This can hold you back from developing relationships
- Shy fixed-mindset people avoid meeting people more socially skilled

### Growth Mindset

- You're not afraid of failing, of difficult things
- You look forward to challenges. "This is hard. This is fun."
- Failing doesn't mean you're a failure
- Failures hurt but they don't define you
- You get less depressed
- You value the journey, regardless of the outcome
- If you want something badly and can achieve it, you go for it
- Other people are allies
- You reflect, analyse, and take control
- You are more likely to state honest opinions, express disagreements
- Shy growth-minded people look at social situations as challenges
- Take control of your shyness
- Set themselves up for success: plan, stick to plans…

NASA rejected people with pure successes vs people who bounced back from failures.

Jack Welch hired based on capacity for growth.

From "Good to Great" (James C Collins),

> The minute a leader allows himself to become the primary reality people worry about, rather than reality being the primary reality, you have a recipe for mediocrity, or worse.

Managers should:

- Present skills as learnable
- Value learning and perseverance, not ready-made talent
- Give feedback in a way that promotes learning
- Present managers as sources for learning

Fixed mindset people are more likely to be shy, worry about what other people think, feel anxious meeting new people.

> Shy people may be wonderful and interesting, but they often can't show it with someone new.

In a shit job…

- Don't complain
- Be helpful
