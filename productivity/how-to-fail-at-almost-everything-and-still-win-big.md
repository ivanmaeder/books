# How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big

By Scott Adams (2013)

> The most important metric to track is your personal energy.

> When I was a commercial loan officer for a large bank in San Francisco, my boss taught us that you should never make a loan to someone who is following his passionâ€¦ [The] best loan customer is one who has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at something that looks good on a spreadsheet.

> Energy is good. Passion is bullshit.

## My Notes

Maximise your energy (sleep well, eat well, exercise, avoid stress, etc).

ðŸ’¡ Use systems, not goals.

E.g.,

- Losing 10 kilos is a goal; exercising daily is a system
- Making $1,000,000 is a goal; being a serial entrepreneur is a system

Goals are far away, youâ€™re never there; youâ€™ll always be frustrated. With systems you succeed every day you use your system. And this keeps your energy up.
