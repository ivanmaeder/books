# Letting Go of the Words

By Janice Redish (2007)

## My Notes

- Answer the questions in reader's minds
- Give people only what they need
- Inverted pyramid style
- Simple, straightforward sentences
- "We" for the company, "you" for the reader
- Lists, especially short lists
- Tables when you have numbers to compare; or if-then sentences
- Don't centre text in tables
- Lists, tables, headings, etc break up walls of text
- No cute terms, or terms used internally or for marketing, or even unclear product names
- Use the words of your readers
- Underline is for links only
