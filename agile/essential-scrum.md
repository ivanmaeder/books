# Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process

By Kenneth S Rubin (2012)

## My Notes

### Cynefin Framework
Different domains for categorising work:

- Obvious
	- The correct actions are known by all
	- E.g., writing an email
- Complicated
	- The correct actions are known by experts
	- E.g., writing a sales proposal
- Emergent
	- The correct actions are discovered as work progresses
	- E.g., the [marshmallow problem](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower?language=en)
- Chaotic
	- You must take action (any action) without waiting, and then re-evaluate the situation
- Disorder
	- You're acting as if you were in one domain but you're really in another
	- E.g., you're doing waterfall and ignoring the inherent uncertainty of the work

### Agile vs Waterfall

In waterfall:

- Planning/designing/specifying happens you know the least about the work (at the beginning)
- Large batch transfers and doing things sequentially (first requirements, then design, etc) create overhead and critical paths, and encourages lots of work-in-progress
- Changing course in waterfall is hard (diverting from the plan can mean scrapping a whole lot of work that was already done: e.g., specifications, designs, plans)

In agile:

- Allows definitions to be delayed (to avoid the risk of building the wrong thing, take advantage of up to date information, etc)
- Cross-functional teams remove the need for batch transfers
- Sprints limit work-in-progress
- T-shaped resources and queue management (how?) remove critical paths
- Progress is measured by work delivered and validated; not a plan being followed

---

Focus on idle work (the baton, not the runners).

Always have extra good-to-haves so you can discard features at crunch time.

Levels of authority:

- Tell: manager makes decision
- Sell: manager convinces
- Consult: manager gets input and then makes decision
- Agree: make decision together
- Advise: manager advises, decision made by team
- Inquire: manager asks after team's made the decision
- Delegate: manager let's team do it all
