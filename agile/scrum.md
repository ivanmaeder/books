# Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time

By Ron Jeffries (2014)

## My Notes

About not taking credit for half-done work:

> You've expended the effort but haven't created any valueâ€¦ Doing half of something is essentially doing nothing.

> Multitasking makes you stupid.

How do you create a thriving (happy) atmosphere?

- Encourage autonomy
- Make sure employees know everything going on
- Zero tolerance for incivility
- Quick and direct feedback
