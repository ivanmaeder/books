# Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst

By Robert Sapolsky (2017)

> In a 2008 study in Science, subjects were given either five dollars or twenty dollars; half were instructed to spend it that day on themselves, half on someone else (ranging from a friend to a charity). And comparisons of self-assessments of happiness at the beginning and end of the day showed that neither the larger amount of money nor the opportunity to spend it on oneself increased happiness; only spending it on someone else did.

## My Notes

### Willpower

Self-control is a finite resource (frontal neurons are expensive cells).

> It's great if your frontal cortex lets you avoid temptation, allowing you to do the harder, better thing. But it's usually more effective if doing that better thing has become so automatic that it isn't hard.

### Stress

- You make bad decisions
- You learn fear association
- Reduces your ability to multitask
- Reduces your ability to assess risk
- Makes you act out of habit

> Stress can disrupt cognition, impulse control, emotional regulation, decision making, empathy, and prosociality

> Mobilizing energy while sprinting for your life helps save you. Do the same thing chronically because of a stressful thirty-year mortgage, and you're at risk for various metabolic problems.

> Contemporary studies show that the worst stress-related health typically occurs in middle management, with its killer combo of high work demands but little autonomyâ€”responsibility without control.

### Emotional Intelligence

ðŸ’¡ Emotional and social intelligence predict adult success and happiness better than IQ or grades.

> It's all about social memory, emotional perspective taking, impulse control, empathy, ability to work with others, self-regulation.

### Gossip

> Gossiping serves numerous purposes. It helps for reality testing ("Is it just me, or was he being a total jerk?"), passing news ("Two guesses who just happened to get a foot cramp during the hairiest part of the hunt today"), and building consensus ("Something needs to be done about this guy"). Gossip is the weapon of norm enforcement.

> Anthropologists, studying everyone from hunter-gatherers to urbanites, have found that about two thirds of everyday conversation is gossip, with the vast majority of it being negative. As has been said, gossip (with the goal of shaming) is a weapon of the weak against the powerful.

### Empathy

> It is tempting to think that feeling someone's pain is necessarily virtuous in its own right. The peril of empathy isnâ€™t simply that it can make us feel bad, but that it can make us feel good, which can in turn encourage us to think of empathy as an end in itself rather than part of a process, a catalyst.
