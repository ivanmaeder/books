# The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep is Broken and how to Fix it

By W Chris Winter (2017)

## My Notes

Lack of sleep can lead to: hypertension, heart attack, elevated blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart failure, migraine, atrial fibrillation, depression, bed-wetting, or neurodegenerative disorders and memory disturbances like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

It looks like sleeping on your side is better for cleaning out the brain.

üí° The habit of not falling asleep, or arousal when getting into bed... that's hard to break. To begin with you don't want to get into that habit, but it may be too late.

‚è∞ Things that reset our clocks: sun, mealtimes, exercise, social interactions, temperature and sleep.

Set up a good environment:

- Dirty room = hyperarousal
- Cool bed, comfortable pillow

Have a bedtime routine, like kids (let your brain know what's coming).

No food 2 to 3 hours before bedtime.

Consider meditation before bed, or a hot shower/bath.

Try exercising in the morning, in full sunlight.

Try to stay in bed and at least rest.

For hardcore issues, consider sleep restriction (CBT).
