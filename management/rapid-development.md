# Rapid Development

By Steve McConnell (1996)

> The effects of individual ability, individual motivation, team ability, and team motivation dwarf other productivity factors.

## My Notes

### Estimates

- Use estimate ranges
- Aim for accuracy, not precision (a larger range may be more accurate because of more uncertainty)
- Estimates early in a project are off by a factor of four. They slowly get better and aren't correct until project completion
- The correct response to a missed milestone is to multiply the whole schedule by the magnitude of the slip. Or change the product or cost

> Projects hardly ever make up lost time.

> Programmers tend to underestimate their projects by 20 to 30 percent.

> I am most opposed to overly optimistic scheduling because it doesn't work. It doesn't result in shorter actual schedules; it results in longer ones.

### Quality

> Projects that aim from the beginning at having the lowest number of defects usually also have the shortest schedules.

> Given the same set of requirements, developers will create solutions that vary by as much as a factor of 10 in the amounts of code they requireâ€¦ If you're on a rapid-development schedule, you can't afford to create a pressure-cooker environment in which people are too rushed to find the solution that is one-tenth as expensive to implement as the others.

> Developers derive some of their self-esteem from the products they develop. If they develop a high-quality product, they feel good. If they develop a low-quality product, they don't feel as good.

> If you feel that your developers won't be able to build a high-quality product in the time available, let the developers come to that conclusion themselves.

### User Involvement

> In a survey of 8,000 projects, the Standish Group found that the number one reason that projects succeed is user involvement.

### Management

- "People will work harder to achieve their own goals than to achieve someone else's"
- People must experience meaning in their work, responsibility for the outcome, and know the results of their efforts
- Reward as a gesture of appreciation, not as an incentive (intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation)
- Use the Hawthorne effect to your advantage: "Run every software project as an experiment"

### Teams

- Should be on a mission
- Have a sense of identity
- Results-driven
- Mutual trust
- Autonomy
- Empowerment
- Clear roles and accountabilities
- Coaching
- Fact-based decision-making

> When you cut across this set of studies, the bottom line is that among groups with different backgrounds and different levels of experience, there is about a 5-to-1 difference in productivity. Among groups with similar backgrounds and similar levels of experience, there is about a 2.5-to-1 difference in productivity.

> Group cohesiveness contributes more to productivity than project members' individual capabilities or experience.

> Make the team responsible for its actions rather than making individuals on the team responsible for their individual actions.
