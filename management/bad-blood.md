# Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup
By John Carreyrou (2018)

## My Notes

True story of what not to do:

- Lack of patience for and understanding of the process (just because you want it doesn't mean you can get it)
- Fearful, and so going from one thing to another ("lurching from one ill-conceived initiative to another")
- Confusing aptitude with assent/sycophancy (disagreeing with me = you're inept) 💡
- Confusing attitude with working hours (not working long hours = not committed) 💡
- Not listening, not being open to feedback or different points of view
- Not being open (transparent) with employees
- "Loose relationship with the truth” 😂
- Inability to be satisfied
