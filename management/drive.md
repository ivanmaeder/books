# Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

By Daniel H Pink (2009)

> Involve people in goal-setting. Would you rather set your own goals or have them foisted upon you? Thought so.

## My Notes

Use extrinsic rewards for menial work only. Otherwise, they can have a negative effect (to avoid this they should be unexpected and "offered only after the task is complete").

Hire Type I people (intrinsically motivated), not Type X people (seek extrinsic rewards). Type I:

- Seek to master
- Want to control their lives
- Outperform
- Higher self-esteem
- Better relationships
- Greater well-being

> Type I behavior is made, not born.

Type I people look for:

- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

[Carol Dweck](../productivity/mindset.md):

> Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life. Effort means you care about something, that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it. It would be an impoverished existence if you were not willing to value things and commit yourself to working toward them.

Praise effort, not intelligence; praise in private and make it specific.
