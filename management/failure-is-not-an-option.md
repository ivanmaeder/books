# Failure is Not an Option
By Gene Kranz (2000)

## My Notes

It's a different way of working:

- Everything needs to be ironed out beforehand. Alternatives need to be fleshed out, procedures for every case defined
- You can’t brainstorm, argue or second-guess during countdown

Otherwise, it's business as usual:

> My team respected me because I did the dirty work and never pulled rank. I assigned the work responsibilities and once I set up the plan I stuck to it. I took the risks to let people stretch and grow and I took the heat, and deserved it, especially when I decided there would be no holidays, no vacations.

> Apollo succeeded at critical moments like this because the bosses had no hesitation about assigning crucial tasks to one individual, trusting his judgment, and then getting out of his way.

> Success belonged to the team; failure was ultimately my responsibility.

> Trust is key in our business. If someone says a problem is closed, it is closed. In flight control, if you didn’t have trust in your fellow controllers you could not get the job done.

> I also thought about the legacy of my generation: trust, values, teamwork.
